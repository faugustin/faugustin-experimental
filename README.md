======================

I'm trying to learn and use different scripts on my wordpress sites.
Lately I'm digging into Foundation (+) and on my old P4 Win7 it all works; sass, Ruby, Nodejs all from commandline. The more I dig it seems like Angularjs is coming. I used to love jQuery (still do), but I'm an adhd person so my active periods of studying varies. It's some four years since I had a period like now. A problem is that I lose motivation, I don't work so when my intensity slows down I can't seem to continue. I'm really a musician but very interested in programming languages.
